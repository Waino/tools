# Usage:
#   If you have a project consisting of several scripts that are intended to be
#   run in order, a good self-documenting convention is to prefix them with
#   numbers 01_foo.sh 02_bar.sh etc. This tool helps the renaming when you
#   notice that you need to add a step in the middle.
# 
# Usage example:
#   Add a new step number 05, by renaming the current 05 to 06 and incrementing
#   all the following ones by one.
#       inject_script_step.py 05
