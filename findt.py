# Usage:
#   Given a unique pattern matching the command line of a running command
#   (COMMAND column in *ps* output), tries to find the terminal in which that
#   command is running, and focus the terminal window.
# 
#   Useful if you have way too many terminals open.
# 
# Usage example:
#   findt.py a_file_open_in_some_editor

# Depends on xdotool package
