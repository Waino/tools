# Usage:
#   Tries to reformat a LaTeX table, to space-align columns.
#   This has no effect on the pdf, but improves readability of the source.
#   This tool takes **only the innards** of a single table
#   (the rows, containing columns separated by &)
#   and tries to reformat it.
#   May eat your cat.

# Usage example:
#   Most effective when called using a keybind in your favorite editor.
#   spacealign_latex_table.py < original > reformatted
